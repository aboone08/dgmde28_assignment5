Question
**1.	Of the object variations we have learned, which feels the most useful to you?**
Constructor functions for the only reason that the new keyword makes sense to me. I do understand that the different variatrions can serve different purposes depending on the end result or use of the code. There may be times where something is more straight forward so something literal would be advantageous or object.create() may be useful when there is a specific prototype in mind. 

**2.	What was the easiest part of this assignment?**
The CSS and thinking through color combinations.
